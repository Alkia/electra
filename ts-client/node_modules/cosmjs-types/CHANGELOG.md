## [0.6.1] - 2022-12-22

### Changed

- Bring back fromJSON/toJSON ([#55])

[#55]: https://github.com/confio/cosmjs-types/pull/55

## [0.6.0] - 2022-12-08

### Changed

- Code generation was migrated from ts-proto to
  [telescope](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/telescope) (#44). This gives us
  faster and better Cosmos specific code generation. This might come with minor
  breaking changes in the 0.6 release series. Feel free to stick to 0.5.x until
  the end of 2022. Then all potential issues should be fixed.
- Some common types are now exported at the package root. E.g.
  `import { DeepPartial } from "cosmjs-types"`.
- `fromJSON`/`toJSON` are not generated anymore. They were never needed for
  CosmJS and do not produce a Cosmos SDK compatible JSON.
- The TypeScript build target is now ES2020,
  [analogue to CosmJS 0.30](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1002).

## [0.5.2] - 2022-10-11

- Migrate from yarn to npm
- Upgrade ts-proto to 1.126.1 and regenerate code
- Upgrade Cosmos SDK protos to 0.45.8
- Upgrade wasmd protos to 0.28.0
- Add ibc.applications.interchain_accounts types ([#36])
