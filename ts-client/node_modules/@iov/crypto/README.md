# @iov/crypto

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@iov/crypto.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iov/crypto)

@iov/crypto contains low-level cryptographic functionality used in other @iov
libraries. Little of it is implemented here, but mainly it is a curation of
external libraries along with correctness tests. We add type-safety, some more
checks, and a simple API to these libraries. This can also be freely imported
outside of IOV-Core based applications.
